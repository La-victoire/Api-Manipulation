# React Paginated To-Do List

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a React-based to-do list that fetches tasks from an API and implements pagination for better usability. Users can navigate between pages to view tasks in batches of 20 items per page.

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches to-dos from an API
- Implements **pagination** to navigate between pages
- Search functionality with **URL updates** (URLSearchParams)
- Clean and modular React components
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React
- React Router (for navigation & search handling)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Fetch API (to get to-do data)

## 📥 Installation & Running Locally
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
 cd your-repo-name
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
 npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Development Server
```sh
 npm run dev  # If using Vite

```
This will start the project at `http://localhost:3000/` (or another available port).

## 📌 How to Use
1. The homepage displays a list of to-dos with pagination.
2. Click on a **page number** to view the next 20 tasks.
3. Use the **search bar** to filter tasks by title (search updates the URL dynamically).
4. Click on any task for more details (if applicable).

## 🌟 Possible Improvements
If given more time, the following features would be implemented:
- **Utilize additional API data** to create a **mock blog application** with comments, likes, and user profiles.
- **Enhance user experience** by adding a means of creating custom to-do tasks.
- **Implement authentication** to associate tasks with user profiles.
- **Improve search functionality** to allow filtering by multiple fields.
